## Topic 14: Chi-Squared Tests for Goodness of Fit and Independence

###

In this workbook, we consider methods two new methods for testing claims corresponding to categorical data with possibly more than two levels. Our first method is called the $\chi^2$ (Chi-Squared) Test for Goodnedd of Fit and can be used for testing whether a sample gives evidence to suggest that an assumed discrete distribution is not an appropriate model for a categorical variable. The second is called the $\chi^2$ Test for Independence, and can be used for testing whether two categorical variables are independent of one-another. You'll be exposed to some examples and some video explanations before being asked to try examples on your own.

###

Consider a sociologist who is interested in better understanding incarceration rates in the state of New Hampshire. The researcher is interested in determining whether minority populations are disproportionately represented in State Pentitentiaries. Using the most recent estimates from the [United States Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/NH), we see that the population of New Hampshire has the following racial breakdown as of 2019: white (89.8%), black (1.8%), hispanic (4.0%), other (4.4%). A reasonable expectation is that the incarcerated population in New Hampshire should roughly reflect this same distribution. 

###

Say that the researcher took a random sample of 1000 inmates in State Penitentiaries across the state of New Hampshire and observed the following results. In the sample, 130 inmates were white, 584 were black, and 243 were hispanic, and 43 were of another race. The researcher wants to determine whether this sample of inmates refutes the notion that the state prison population in New Hampshire is reflective of the State's breakdown of population by race. We know that a new random sample of 1000 inmates would provide results different than these, so how do we determine whether we have a statistically significant result?

###

We'll come back to our incarceration example, but for now let's listen to Dr. &Ccedil;etinkaya-Rundel introduce the $\chi^2$ Goodness of Fit Test. Watch the video below.

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Uk36WGxujkc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

###

Dr. &Ccedil;etinkaya-Rundel discussed an example of racial bias in jury selection. Before we see if we can apply the techniques from her discussion to our example from state prison populations in New Hampshire, let's recap a bit.

###

In the video, we saw that a $\chi^2$ test statistic does not follow a normal distribution -- instead, the test statistic involved in a Goodness of Fit Test follows what is called a $\chi^2$-distribution. Although we are working with a new distribution, the principles of the test statistic and corresponding probability distribution remain the samle. The test statistic is a metric for how far away our sample falls from the expected result and the $p$-value is the tail area -- representing the probability of observing a sample at least as extreme as ours, under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. Since the $\chi^2$ test statistic is always non-negative, we will be interested in the *upper tail*.

###

Running a $\chi^2$ test for goodness of fit involves the following assumptions:

+ A sample should be taken randomly, and if done without replacement, should include less than 10% of the entire population.
+ The sample should be large enough that each group should have an expected count of at least five observations.

###

Okay, let's get back to our application to racial representation in the New Hampshire state prison population. As a reminder, we've discovered that New Hampshire is estimated to be 89.8% white, 1.8% black, 4.0% hispanic, and 4.4% of other races in 2019. Additionally, we have a sample of 1000 inmates from state prisons in New Hampshire and observed the following: 130 inmates were white, 584 were black, and 243 were hispanic, and 43 were of another race. We want to know if this sample provides evidence to suggest that the state prison population in New Hampshire does not reflect the racial demographics of the State.

###

Use the following code blocks to input or calculate the expected counts for each race.

Compute the number of prisoners out of the 1000 who are expected to be *white*.
```{r exp-white, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r exp-white-check}
grade_result(
  pass_if(~ .result == (1000*0.898))
)
```

###

Compute the number of prisoners out of the 1000 who are expected to be *black*.
```{r exp-black, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r exp-black-check}
grade_result(
  pass_if(~ .result == (1000*0.018))
)
```

###

Compute the number of prisoners out of the 1000 who are expected to be *hispanic*.
```{r exp-hispanic, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r exp-hispanic-check}
grade_result(
  pass_if(~ .result == (1000*0.040))
)
```

###

Compute the number of prisoners out of the 1000 who are expected to be of other races.
```{r exp-other, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r exp-other-check}
grade_result(
  pass_if(~ .result == (1000*0.044))
)
```

###

Now we're ready to compute the test statistic. Remember that in Dr. &Ccedil;etinkaya-Rundel's video she introduced the $\chi^2$ statistic as follows:
$$\displaystyle{\chi^2 = \sum_{i = 1}^{k}{\frac{\left(\text{observed} - \text{expected}\right)^2}{\text{expected}}}}$$
where $k$ denotes the number of groups.

Use the code block below to enter or compute the $chi^2$ test statistic. The code block has been pre-populated to get you started with computing the test statistic.
```{r test-stat, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
#Define the observed values
observed <- c(130, 584, 243, 43)
#Define the expected values -- you should input these, be sure to use the same order as in the "observed" vector.
expected <- c()

#Now compute the chi-squared test statistic.

```


```{r test-stat-hint}
expected <- c(898, 18, 40, 44)
sum((observed - expected)^2/expected)
```

```{r test-stat-check}
observed <- c(130, 584, 243, 43)
expected <- c(898, 18, 40, 44)

grade_result(
  pass_if(~ (abs(.result - sum((observed - expected)^2/expected)) < 0.01))
)
```

### 

Use the code block below to enter the degrees of freedom for the $\chi^2$-distribution associated with our test statistic.
```{r df, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r df-check}
grade_result(
  pass_if(~ (.result == 3))
)
```

###

Use the code block below to compute the $p$-value associated with this test. Remember that you can use the function `pchisq(q, df)` to compute the probability to the left of the boundary value `q` under a $\chi^2$ distribution with `df` degrees of freedom.

```{r compute-p, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r compute-p-hint}
1 - pchisq(q, df)
```

```{r compute-p-check}
grade_result(
  pass_if(~ (abs(.result - (1 - pchisq(19484.62, df = 4 - 1))) < 0.0001))
)
```

###

Assume the test was to be conducted at the $\alpha = 0.05$ level of significance. Answer the following to determine the results of the test.
```{r chisq-gof-conclusion, echo = FALSE}
quiz(
  question_radio(
    "What is the result of the test?",
    answer("Since $p \\geq \\alpha$, we do not have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis."),
  answer("Since $p \\geq \\alpha$, we accept the null hypothesis."),
  answer("Since $p < \\alpha$, we reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis.", correct = TRUE),
  answer("Since $p < \\alpha$, we fail to reject the null hypothesis."),
  answer("It is impossible to determine."),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  random_answer_order = TRUE
  ),
  question_radio(
  "The result of the test means that",
  answer("The sample data did not provide significant evidence to suggest that state prison population in New Hampshire does not reflect the demographics of the State."),
  answer("The sample data proved that state prison population in New Hampshire does not reflect the demographics of the State."),
  answer("The sample data provided significant evidence to suggest that state prison population in New Hampshire does not reflect the demographics of the State.", correct = TRUE),
  answer("The sample data provided significant evidence to suggest that the sample of prisoners from state prisons in New Hampshire did not match the racial demographics of the State."),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  random_answer_order = TRUE
  )
)
```

## Tests for Independence

###

We consider an application in which we are interested in determining whether level of household income (`IncomeLevel`) and `DrugUse` by adolescents are independent. In our application we will consider a simulated dataset based off of metrics from the [*2019 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System*](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/questionnaires/index.htm). The simulated data is stored for you in a data frame called `BRFSSsim`.

###

Let's see Dr. &Ccedil;etinkaya-Rundel for an introduction.

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yjrsfNdja0U" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

###

Recap Dr. &Ccedil;edinkaya-Rundel's discussion here.

###

We now return to our simulated BRFSS data. Each row of the simulated dataset is meant to represent a response from a single adolescent in the USA. Recall that we are interested in determining whether there is evidence to suggest an association between the sociological variables `IncomeLevel` and `DrugUse`. The variable `IncomeLevel` measures level of household income, with the observed values *poverty*, *lowIncome*, *middleIncome*, and *highIncome*. The variable `drugUse` denotes whether the individual reports using any illicit drug in the past year, as a *yes* or *no* response. 

We suspect the following marginal distributions: within the US, approximately 16% of households fall below the poverty line, approximately 38% can be classified as low income, about 35% as middle income, and the remaining 11% as high income. Additionally, approximately 14% of adolescents are estimated to have used illicit drugs in any given year.

###

Assume that the results in the `BRFSSsim` dataset are collected by a researcher wishing to determine whether adolescent drug use and household income are independent of one another. 

###

  answer("$\\begin{array}{ll} H_0: \\text{Household income and drug use are independent of one another.} \\\\ H_a: \\text{Household income and druge use are dependent.}\\end{array}$", correct = TRUE),
  answer("$\\begin{array}{ll} H_0: \\text{Household income and drug use are dependent.} \\\\ H_a: \\text{Household income and druge use are independent of one another.}\\end{array}$"),
  answer("$\\begin{array}{ll} H_0: p_{\\text{household income}} = p_{\\text{drug use}} \\\\ H_a: p_{\\text{household income}} \\neq p_{\\text{drug use}}\\end{array}$"),
answer("$\\begin{array}{ll} H_0: \\mu_{\\text{household income}} = \\mu_{\\text{drug use}} \\\\ H_a: \\mu_{\\text{household income}} \\neq \\mu_{\\text{drug use}}\\end{array}$"),
allow_retry = TRUE,
random_answer_order = TRUE
)
```

###

Under the assumption of the null hypothesis, compute the expected number of the 2500 responses to fall in the poverty and drug use group:
```{r poverty-drug-use, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r poverty-drug-use-check}
grade_result(
  pass_if(~ abs(.result - 2500*0.16*0.14) < 0.5)
)
```

<div id = "poverty-drug-use-hint"> Remember from basic probability that two events, $A$ and $B$ are independent if $\mathbb{P}\left[A \text{ and } B\right] = \mathbb{P}\left[A\right]\cdot \mathbb{P}\left[B\right]$. Apply the same logic here.</div>

###

Under the assumption of the null hypothesis, compute the expected number of the 2500 responses to fall in the low income and drug use group:
```{r lowInc-drug-use, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r lowInc-drug-use-check}
grade_result(
  pass_if(~ abs(.result - 2500*0.38*0.14) < 0.5)
)
```

###

Under the assumption of the null hypothesis, compute the expected number of the 2500 responses to fall in the middle income and drug use group:
```{r middleInc-drug-use, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r middleInc-drug-use-check}
grade_result(
  pass_if(~ abs(.result - 2500*0.35*0.14) < 0.5)
)
```

###

Under the assumption of the null hypothesis, compute the expected number of the 2500 responses to fall in the high income and drug use group:
```{r highInc-drug-use, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r highInc-drug-use-check}
grade_result(
  pass_if(~ abs(.result - 2500*0.11*0.14) < 0.5)
)
```

###

###

In the video, Dr. &Ccedil;etinkaya-Rundel reiterates that we can compute the $\chi^2$ test statistic using a formula analogous to the one we used for $\chi^2$ Goodness of Fit. We have
$$\displaystyle{\chi^2 = \sum_{i = 1}^{k}{\frac{\left(\text{observed} - \text{expected}\right)^2}{\text{expected}}}}$$
where $k$ represents the number of cells in the variable-comparison tables. That is, $k$ is given by the product of the number of levels underneath each of the categorical variables, so here we have $k = 8$.

###

Use the code block below to compute the $\chi^2$ test statistic. Look back to our earlier application if you need a refresher!
```{r chi-sq-ind, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r chi-sq-ind-check}
expected <- c(344, 817, 752.5, 236.5, 56, 133, 122.5, 38.5)
grade_result(
  pass_if(~ (abs(.result - sum((observedInd - expected)^2/expected)) < 0.05))
)
```

###

Compute or input the degrees of freedom associated with this test for independence.
```{r df-ind, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r df-ind-check}
grade_result(
  pass_if(~ (.result == 3))
)
```

<div id = "df-ind-hint"> Remember that, in the video, Dr. &Ccedil;etinkaya-Rundel mentions that the degrees of freedom can be calculated as $df = \left(k-1\right)\cdot\left(\ell - 1\right)$ where $k$ and $\ell$ are the numbers of levels underneath each of the individual categorical variables involved in the test.</div>

###

Now that we've computed the test statistic and degrees of freedom associated with our test, we can compute the $p$-value. Remember that the $p$-value associated with a $\chi^2$ test for independence can be computed with the `pchisq()` function as was utilized before.

###

Use the code block below to compute the $p$-value associated with this test.
```{r compute-p-indep, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r compute-p-indep-hint}
1 - pchisq(q, df)
```

```{r compute-p-indep-check}
grade_result(
  pass_if(~ (abs(.result - (1 - pchisq(sum((observedInd - c(344, 817, 752.5, 236.5, 56, 133, 122.5, 38.5))^2/c(344, 817, 752.5, 236.5, 56, 133, 122.5, 38.5)), df = (4 - 1)*(2 - 1)))) < 0.0001))
)
```

###

Assume the test was to be conducted at the $\alpha = 0.05$ level of significance. Answer the following to determine the results of the test.
```{r chisq-indep-conclusion, echo = FALSE}
quiz(
  question_radio(
    "What is the result of the test?",
    answer("Since $p \\geq \\alpha$, we do not have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis."),
  answer("Since $p \\geq \\alpha$, we accept the null hypothesis."),
  answer("Since $p < \\alpha$, we reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis.", correct = TRUE),
  answer("Since $p < \\alpha$, we fail to reject the null hypothesis."),
  answer("It is impossible to determine."),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  random_answer_order = TRUE
  ),
  question_radio(
  "The result of the test means that",
  answer("The sample data did provide significant evidence to suggest that household income and illicit drug use by adolescents are dependent.", correct = TRUE),
  answer("The sample data proved that household income and illicit drug use by adolescents are dependent."),
  answer("The sample data provided significant evidence to suggest that household income and illicit drug use by adolescents are independent."),
  answer("The sample data provided significant evidence to suggest that household income and illicit drug use by adolescents were dependent for the individuals in our sample."),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  random_answer_order = TRUE
  )
)
```

## Summary

Good work. Through this workbook you considered scenarios in which you wished to test claimes involving a) a single categorical variable with more than two levels, and b) multiple categorical variables for which at least one variable has more than two levels. In both scenarios you utilized a $\chi^2$ distribution and test statistic. Hopefully you noted that the $\chi^2$ statistic measures deviation from expectation, similarly to our test statistics for other tests.

At this point, you have the ability to test claims involving a single proportion, comparisons of proportions across two populations, to determine whether a population follows an assumed distribution for a categorical variable, and to determine whether two catgorical variables are independent of one another within a given population. We'll continue our journey through inferential statistics, but switch to numerical data now. Keep up the great work!
