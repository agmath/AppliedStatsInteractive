## Topic 12: Inference Practice

###

In the Topic 11 workbook you learned more about statistical inference (in the form of hypothesis tests and confidence intervals) for categorical variables. In this workbook we'll continue where we left off at the end of Topic 11. You'll start with a video explaining the [*Standard Error Decision Tree*](www/StdErrorDecisionTree.pdf){target="_blank"}, and then move on to a few practice problems with the opportunity to view a few worked solutions if you need some help! Make sure to try the problems and mark down the questions you have.

## A Tour of the Decision Tree

From this point on you'll make heavy use of the [*Standard Error Decision Tree*](www/StdErrorDecisionTree.pdf){target="_blank"} that was referenced earlier. The tree may look intimidating for now, but it contains almost everything we'll need to get through the majority of what remains in our course. Let's start with a tour.

## Problems with Walkthroughs

The two problems in this section have attached video walkthroughs -- try answering the question parts before watching the corresponding walkthrough video. If you run into trouble, hit play on the video and see if you can identify the answers from my walkthrough. Be sure to mark down any questions you have. As a reminder, click below for the detailed versions of the general strategies for inference tasks.

**Try It 1:** The result of a poll was that 48% of 331 randomly sampled Americans who decide not to go to college do so because they cannot afford it.

  + Calculate a 90% confidence interval for the proportion of Americans who decide not to go to college because they cannot afford it, and interpret the result in context.

**Try It 2:** A USA Today/Gallup poll conducted between 2010 and 2011 asked a group of unemployed and underemployed Americans if they have had major problems in their relationships with their spouse or another close family member as a result of not having a job (if unemployed) or not having a full-time job (if underemployed). 27% of the 1,145 unemployed respondents and 25% of the 675 underemployed respondents said they had major problems in relationships as a result of their employment status. Conduct a test to determine whether an association exists between the presence of relationship problems and whether an individual is unemployed or underemployed. Use the $\alpha = 0.05$ level of significance.
