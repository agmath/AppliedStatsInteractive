## Foundations for Inference

In this workbook we'll begin investigating the true power of statistics -- using sample data to make accurate claims about a population (even when we don't have access to the entire population). We'll start by exploring the connection between a *Population Distribution* and the distribution of sample means, often called the *Sampling Distribution*. We'll do this through a series of simple, interactive code blocks which you'll run and use to answer questions.

## Exploring the connection between population and sampling distributions

Start by viewing the following following video from the New York Times.

###

So the video claimed that the sampling distribution can help us answer questions about the population. This is really important because, as we mentioned in our first Workbook, Census is almost always impossible. Use the code blocks below to explore the connection between the population and the sampling distribution for various different populations.

**Normally Distributed Population:** Work with the following code block to explore the connection between the population distribution and sampling distribution when the population follows a normal distribution. Use your explorations to answer the questions that follow.
```{r norm-pop-samp-dist, exercise = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 4}
#Define the population mean (feel free to change)
mean <- 80
#Define the population standard deviation (feel free to change)
sd <- 5
#Define the sample size (feel free to change)
size <- 1
#Define the number of samples to be taken (feel free to change)
numSamps <- 10000

You'll notice in the plot on the left, that assuming a normal distribution for the population is an extremely poor choice. Use your explorations to answer the questions that follow.

Good work through the previous sets of questions. Think about your answers to those, and try to answer the following questions about the connection between population distributions and sampling distributions in general.

    "Consider a generic population distribution. What can be said about the shape of the sampling distribution?",
    answer("For large enough sample sizes, the sampling distribution is nearly normal.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("The sampling distribution is always nearly normal."),

```

## The Central Limit Theorem

What you just discovered through the last section and corresponding questions is what statisticians call the *Central Limit Theorem*. It is what was discussed in the *CreatureCast* video at the beginning of this workbook. This is one of the most important theorems in all of statistics and it is what will allow us to make and test claims about populations for the remainder of our course.

###

**Central Limit Theorem (simplified):** Regardless of the shape of a population distribution, for sample sizes large enough to overcome skew, the distribution of sample means (the so-called *sampling distribution*) is approximately normal. Furthermore, the mean of the sampling distribution is the same as the population mean ($\mu$), and the spread of the sampling distribution can be described by the *standard error* ($S_E$) which depends on the standard deviation of the population distribution and the size of the samples.

###

For now we'll focus on one particular application of the Central Limit Theorem to a single population. Consider $X\sim N\left(\mu,\sigma\right)$, then the Central Limit Theorem states that the distribution of samples means is as follows: $\displaystyle{\bar{X}_n\sim N\left(\mu, S_E = \sigma/\sqrt{n}\right)}$.

###

Try the following problem.

**Sample Problem:** Suppose you have 46 square foot wall which you want to cover with spraypaint. The brand of spraypaint you plan to use is known to have an average coverage of 10 square feet per can with a standard deviation of 1.5 square feet. Use the code block below to answer the questions that follow.
```{r spraypaint-sandbox, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r spraypaint-questions, echo = FALSE}
quiz(
  question_radio(
    "How many square feet would each can need to cover if you wanted to use only four cans to cover the entire wall?",
    answer("10"),
    answer("10.5"),
    answer("11"),
    answer("11.5", correct = TRUE),
    answer("12"),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question_radio(
    "What is the probability that a single can of spray paint covers at least 11.5 square feet?",
    answer("0.5"),
    answer("0.9772"),
    answer("0.1587", correct = TRUE),
    answer("0.8413"),
    answer("0.0228"),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    random_answer_order = TRUE
  ),
  question_radio(
    "What is the probability that a random sample of four cans of spray paint covering an average of at least 11.5 square feet?",
    answer("0.5"),
    answer("0.9772"),
    answer("0.1587"),
    answer("0.8413"),
    answer("0.0228", correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    random_answer_order = TRUE
  ),
  question_radio(
    "Should we expect to cover the entire wall with only four cans of spray paint, or should we plan to buy 5?",
    answer("We should plan to buy five since it is unlikely (less than 5% chance) that four cans will suffice to cover the whole wall.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("We will probably be fine with four cans -- 11.5 square feet is not much more than the expected average of 10 square feet."),
    answer("Since 11.5 square feet is within one standard deviation of the expected value, it is likely that four will be enough."),
    answer("We should plan to buy five cans -- four cans will only cover 40 square feet."),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    random_answer_order = TRUE
  )
)
```

## Summary

**Summary:** In this workbook you were exposed to the following:

+ If $X$ is a continuous random variable, then for large enough sample sizes ($n$), the sampling distribution for $X$ with samples of size $n$ is approximately normal with mean $\mu$ (the same mean as the population mean) and *Standard Error* (spread) related to the standard deviation of the population and the sample size -- that is, the sampling distribution follows $N\left(\mu, S_E\right)$, where we can predict $S_E$.

  + If we are working with a single sample and are building a sampling distribution of sample means, then the sampling distribution is $\bar{X}_n\sim N\left(\mu, S_E = \sigma/\sqrt{n}\right)$.
  + We can use the `pnorm()` function to compute probabilities associated with the sampling distribution just as we have done previously with normally distributed population data. Just remember to use the *standard error* ($S_E$) to measure spread instead of the standard deviation ($\sigma$).

+ Remember that the presence of *skew* in a population distribution increases the required sample size in order for the Central Limit Theorem to apply. 

  + For moderate skew, samples of size 30 are usually enough to overcome the skew.
  + The more extreme the skew, the larger the sample size must be.
