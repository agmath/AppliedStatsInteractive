## Assessing and Exploring the Normality Assumption

In this workbook we'll continue our investigation into the probability distribution that is most central to statistics: the normal distribution. Here we'll use the graphical tools of R to assess the normality of our data and also learn how to generate random numbers from a normal distribution. In addition, we'll uncover the importance of the normality assumption -- we will see a scenario in which the approximate normality assumption is satisfied and another where it is not. 

## The Data

###

Through this workbook we'll be working with measurements of body dimensions. The data is stored in a data frame called `bdims`. The `bdims` data set contains measurements from 247 men and 260 women, most of whom were considered healthy young adults.

###

Use the `head()` function to take a quick peek at the first few rows of the data.
```{r head-data, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r head-data-solution}
head(bdims)
```

```{r head-data-check}
grade_code()
```

###

You'll see that for every observation we have 25 measurements, many of which are either diameters or girths.  A key to the variable names can be found at  [http://www.openintro.org/stat/data/bdims.php](http://www.openintro.org/stat/data/bdims.php), but we'll be focusing on just three columns to get started: weight in kg (`wgt`), height in cm (`hgt`), and `sex` (`1` indicates male, `0` indicates female).

###

Since males and females tend to have different body dimensions, it will be useful to create two additional data sets: one with only men and another with only women. In the `bdims` dataset females are denoted by a 0 in the `sex` column while males are denoted by a 1 (R chooses labels for levels of unordered factor variables according to alphabetical order). 

###

The code block below is set up to create a dataset `mdims` consisting of only males. First the `bdims` data is passed to the filter function where we keep only those observations which correspond to males, and then the result is stored in the `mdims` object. Add a second line to create a dataset of only females called `fdims`.
```{r subset-mf, exercise = TRUE}
mdims <- bdims %>% filter(sex == 1)

```

```{r subset-mf-solution}
mdims <- bdims %>% filter(sex == 1)
fdims <- bdims %>% filter(sex == 0)
```

```{r subset-mf-check}
grade_code()
```

###

Use the code block below to make a histogram of men's heights and a histogram of women's heights. How would you compare the various aspects of the two distributions? Check back on the data visualization workbook if you need a refresher on plotting.

```{r plot-hgt-hists, exercise = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 4}

```

```{r distribution-quests, echo = FALSE}
quiz(
  question_radio(
    "Which group is taller on average?",
    answer("Males", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Females"),
    answer("It is impossible to tell", message = "There are short and tall people in both distributions, but the average height of one group is larger than the average height of the other group"),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    random_answer_order = TRUE
  ),
  question_radio(
    "Would it be fair to say that the distribution of male heights is approximately normal?",
    answer("Yes. The distribution of male heights follows an approximate bell curve.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("No. The distribution is skewed left.", message = "No real-world data is exactly normally distributed, but if the data is *close enough*, using the normal model is permissible."),
    answer("No. The distribution is skewed right.", message = "No real-world data is exactly normally distributed, but if the data is *close enough*, using the normal model is permissible."),
    answer("No. The distribution is symmetric but is multimodal", message = "No real-world data is exactly normally distributed, but if the data is *close enough*, using the normal model is permissible."),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    random_answer_order = TRUE
  ),
  question_radio(
    "Would it be fair to say that the distribution of female heights is approximately normal?",
    answer("Yes. The distribution of female heights follows an approximate bell curve.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("No. The distribution is skewed left.", message = "No real-world data is exactly normally distributed, but if the data is *close enough*, using the normal model is permissible."),
    answer("No. The distribution is skewed right.", message = "No real-world data is exactly normally distributed, but if the data is *close enough*, using the normal model is permissible."),
    answer("No. The distribution is symmetric but is multimodal", message = "No real-world data is exactly normally distributed, but if the data is *close enough*, using the normal model is permissible."),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    random_answer_order = TRUE
  )
)
```

## Using the normal model

###

In your description of the distributions, did you use words like *bell-shaped* or *normal*?  It's tempting to say so when faced with a unimodal symmetric distribution. That being said, we just *eyeballed it* to answer those previous questions. Below we will explore two methods for assessing how closely our data follows a normal distribution.

###

To see how accurate that description is, we can plot a normal distribution curve on top of a histogram to see how closely the data follow a normal distribution. This normal curve should have the same mean and standard deviation as the data. The code block that follows is preset to do this for the distribution of male heights. Explanations of the code appear below: 

+ Compute the mean and standard deviation for male heights
+ Plot the relative histogram of male heights (this is what `y = ..density..` does)
+ Plot a normal distribution with the same mean and standard deviation as the male heights have (this is what `geom_line()` is doing).

  + $x$ is a set of 200 evenly spaced points between 140 and 200.
  + $y$ is the height of the normal curve with the appropriate mean and standard deviation at each of the $x$-values.

+ Add a title and descriptive axis labels to the plot.

Run the code below to see the normal curve laid on top of the male heights. Once you've done that, adapt the code to plot the distribution of female heights as well as the corresponding normal curve on top of the distribution. Don't forget to update the plot title!
```{r hist-hgt-plus-normal, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
mhgtmean <- mean(mdims$hgt)
mhgtsd <- sd(mdims$hgt)

ggplot() + 
  geom_histogram(data = mdims, mapping = aes(x = hgt, y = ..density..)) + 
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x = seq(140, 200, length.out = 200), 
                          y = dnorm(seq(140, 200, length.out = 200), 
                                    mean = mhgtmean, sd = mhgtsd)),
            color = "blue", lwd = 1.25) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Male Heights", x = "Height (cm)", y = "Proportion")
```

###

Notice how convenient `ggplot`'s layered plotting syntax makes adding multiple objects (the histogram and density curve) to the same plot.

###

**Question:** Based on the plots you built, are you more or less comfortable with the assumption that the heights data follow a nearly normal distribution?

###

Eyeballing the shape of the histogram is one way to determine if the data appear to be nearly normally distributed, but it can be frustrating to decide just how close the histogram is to the curve. An alternative approach involves constructing a normal probability plot, also called a normal Q-Q plot for "quantile-quantile". Execute the code block below to produce a Q-Q plot for female heights.
```{r qq, exercise = TRUE, message = FALSE, results = FALSE}
qqnorm(fdims$hgt)
qqline(fdims$hgt)
```

###

A data set that is nearly normal will result in a normal probability plot where the points closely follow the line.  Any deviations from normality leads to deviations of these points from the line.  The plot for female heights shows points that tend to follow the line but with some errant points towards the tails. We're left with the same problem that we encountered with the histogram above: how close is close enough?

###

A useful way to address this question is to rephrase it as: what do normal probability plots look like for data that I *know* came from a normal distribution?  We can answer this by simulating data from a normal distribution using `rnorm` (which will draw random values from a normal distribution). Execute the code below to draw a random sample of `r length(fdims$hgt)` random heights from the assumed normal distribution of female heights. A histogram will be plotted for convenience -- feel free to run the code block multiple times to see what happens.
```{r sim-norm, exercise = TRUE}
sim_norm <- rnorm(n = length(fdims$hgt), mean = fhgtmean, sd = fhgtsd)

ggplot() + geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = sim_norm))
```

###

In the `rnorm()` function above, the first argument indicates how many numbers you'd like to generate, which we specify to be the same number of heights in the `fdims` data set using the  `length` function. The last two arguments determine the mean and standard deviation of the normal distribution from which the simulated sample will be generated.  We can take a look at the shape of our simulated data set, `sim_norm`, as well as its normal probability plot.

###

Use the code block below to take a random sample of heights (you can copy and paste the `sim_norm` line from the code block above) and make a normal probability plot of the simulated data from the truely normal distribution.

```{r sim-norm-qq-plot, exercise = TRUE}

```

Do all of the points fall exactly on the line?  How does this plot compare to the probability plot for the real data?

###

Even better than comparing the original plot to a single plot generated from a normal distribution is to compare it to many more plots using the following function. The following code block is pre-populated with a custom-built function that will create eight different Q-Q plots from simulated normal data and will also produce the Q-Q plot corresponding to our true female heights data. Run the code block to see the result.
```{r qqnormsim, exercise = TRUE, fig.height = 8}
qqnormsim(fdims$hgt)
```

###

Does the normal probability plot for `fdims$hgt` look similar to the plots created for the simulated data?  That is, do plots "provide evidence" that the female heights are nearly normal?

###

Use the `qqnormsim()` function and the code block below to determine whether or not female weights (`wgt`) appear to come from a normal distribution.
```{r fwght-normal, exercise = TRUE, fig.height = 8}

```

```{r weights-question, echo = FALSE}
question_radio(
  "Does the distribution of female weights seem to be approximately normal?",
  answer("Yes, the Q-Q plot for the weight data looks similar to the Q-Q plots for the simulated data from the known normal distribution."),
  answer("No, the Q-Q plot for the weight data differs from the Q-Q plots for the simulated data from the known normal distribution.", correct = TRUE),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  random_answer_order = TRUE
)
```

## The impact of assumptions

###

Okay, so now you have a slew of tools to judge whether or not a variable is normally distributed.  Why should we care?

It turns out that statisticians know a lot about the normal distribution. Once we decide that a random variable is approximately normal, we can answer all sorts of questions about that variable related to probability. That being said, our conclusions will only be reliable if the assumption we make about the normal model is a reasonable one. We saw that the distribution of female heights was approximately normal, but that the distribution of female weights deviated away from a normal distribution. We'll ask a probability question about each of these variables and see how close our approximated probabilities are to the true empirical probabilities.

###

**Question 1:** What is the probability that a randomly chosen young adult female is taller than 6 feet (about 182 cm)? Use the code block below to answer this question assuming that female heights are normally distributed. That is, use the `pnorm()` function we were introduced to in the previous workbook. (The study that published this data set is clear to point out that the sample was not random and therefore inference to a general population is not suggested.  We do so here only as an exercise.)
```{r prob-height-norm, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r prob-height-norm-check}
grade_result(
  pass_if(~ (abs(.result - (1 - pnorm(182, fhgtmean, fhgtsd))) < 0.001))
)
```

###

Assuming a normal distribution has allowed us to calculate a theoretical probability. If we want to calculate the probability empirically, we simply need to determine how many observations fall above 182 then divide this number by the total sample size. Execute the code block below to do this. Compare the theoretical probability estimate to the empirical probability -- are they similar?
```{r hgt-emp-probability, exercise = TRUE}
sum(fdims$hgt > 182) / length(fdims$hgt)
```

###

Although the probabilities are not exactly the same, they are reasonably close. The closer that your distribution is to being normal, the more accurate the theoretical probabilities will be.

###

**Question 2:** What is the probability that a randomly chosen young adult female weighs more than 80kg? Use the code block below to answer this question making the assumption that female weights are normally distributed (recall that we said this assumption was not a good one).
```{r wgt-norm-prob, exercise = TRUE}

```

###

Compute the empirical probability that a randomly chosen young adult female weighs more than 80kg. Model your approach after the way we did this for heights earlier. Compare the empirical and theoretical probabilities. What can you say?
```{r wgt-emp-prob, exercise = TRUE}

```

###

Notice that your probability estimated using the normal distribution is only half of what the empirical probability is. Since the assumption of approximate normality was far from satisfied with the distribution of weights, the probabilities we estimate from an assumed normal distribution connot be trusted as true approximations for probabilities associated with these weights. If we are to use the normal model then we must be sure that the assumption of approximate normality is satisfied!
