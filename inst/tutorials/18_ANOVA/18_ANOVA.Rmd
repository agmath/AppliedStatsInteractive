## ANalysis Of VAriance (ANOVA)

In this workbook, we consider a method for comparing means from multiple groups. We will use a very famous dataset which contains measurements on several varieties of iris (a type of flower). The flowers are classified as *setosa*, *versicolor*, and *virginica*. You can see a photo of each below. In this workbook we will try to identify whether the iris dataset provides significant evidence to suggest a difference in the average petal widths across the three varieties.

Notice that none of the tools we've been exposed to can be applied directly to help us answer this question. Our hypothesis testing strategies have been limited to comparing numerical measures across one or two populations, but not more. We could apply three separate *one-versus-one* tests (versicolor versus setosa, versicolor versus virginica, and setosa versus virginica), but notice that the probability of an erroneous conclusion explodes. For example, at a 5% level of significance, the probability of making at least one Type I error (an incorrect conclusion of a significant difference) with three comparisons is now $1 - \left(0.95^3\right) \approx 14.26\%$. While it is possible to adjust the level of significance for the individual tests to correct for this, a better option is to conduct an ANalysis Of VAriance -- an ANOVA test.

Dr. &Ccedil;etinkaya-Rundel's explanation in the video went through all of the nitty gritty details of ANOVA. You'll answer a few questions to help you think about what Dr. &Ccedil;etinkaya-Rundel was discussing and hopefully better understand the mechanics of ANOVA. What you really need to remember, however, is that 

+ ANOVA can be used to test whether there is evidence of a significant difference in means across multiple (three or more) populations. 
+ Test statistics resulting from ANOVA do not follow the normal or $t$-distribution, they follow an $F$-distribution instead.
+ The $p$-value resulting from an $F$-distribution is the area from our computed $F$-statistic and into the upper tail of the $F$-distribution. 
  
  + The interpretation of the $p$-value is exactly as it was for our earlier hypothesis tests -- the probability of observing a sample at least as extreme as ours under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true.

Good work so far. Were you confident about your responses on the previous questions? If not, be sure to find a teacher, mentor, or friend to have a discussion with!

In her video, Dr. &Ccedil;etinkaya-Rundel mentions that the computations associated with an ANOVA test are tedious and prone to errors. For this reason, we typically utilize software to run ANOVA tests -- this is exactly what you'll do now.

###

We can run an ANOVA test to compare multiple group means using R's `aov()` function. We'll pass the function a single argument in the form of a formula. Store the result of running `aov(Petal.Width ~ Species, data = iris)` in an object called `ANOVAtable` and then view the results of the ANOVA test by running `summary()` on this object. Use the results to answer the questions that follow.

```{r run-anova, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r run-anova-hint-1}
#Remember that you can store results into variables by
#using the arrow operator.
```

```{r run-anova-hint-2}
#Fill in the blank with the call to `aov()` listed in 
#the paragraph above.

ANOVAtable <- ___
```

```{r run-anova-hint-3}
#Now call summary() on ANOVAtable to view the results
#of the ANOVA test.

ANOVAtable <- aov(Petal.Width ~ Species, data = iris)
summary(___)
```

```{r anova-test-interp, echo = FALSE}
quiz(
  question_radio(
    "How are the `Mean Sq` values related to the other values in the ANOVA table?",
    answer("The `Mean Sq` value is obtained by dividing the `Sum Sq` (sum of squared deviations) by the `Df` (degrees of freedom).", correct = TRUE),
    answer("The `Mean Sq` value is the `F value` divided by the `Sum Sq` (sum of squared deviations)."),
    answer("The `Mean Sq` value is unrelated to the other values in the ANOVA table and are just output by the software as meaningful values."),

    answer("The p-value is less than the level of signficance, so we accept the null hypothesis."),
    answer("The p-value is at least as large as the level of significance, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis."),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    random_answer_order = TRUE
  ),
  question_radio(
    "What is the conclusion interpreted in the context of our original question?",
    answer("The iris data provides significant evidence to suggest that the average petal width is not the same across all three varieties of iris.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("The iris data provides signficant evidence to suggest that the average petal width is the same across all three varieties of iris."),
    answer("The iris data does not provide significant evidence to suggest that the average petal width differs in at least one of the varieties."),
    answer("The iris data provides significant evidence to suggest that all three varieties of iris have different average petal widths."),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    random_answer_order = TRUE
  )
)
```

Notice that the result of the ANOVA test suggested that *at least one of the varieties has a different population mean than the other two varieties*. Unfortunately ANOVA doesn't tell us which one. There are methods which can be used to determine which groups have means that differ from one another, though. 

If you observe statistically significant evidence for a difference in group means from an ANOVA test, you can continue with a *Tukey Test*. The Tukey Test is sometimes referred to as the *Tukey Honest Significant Differences Test* and will run a collection of pairwise tests for differences in group means, with an adjusted $p$-value.

Since our test resulted in the claim that at least one of the species of iris has a different average petal width than the others, we'll continue with a Tukey Test below.

###

In R, we can use the `TukeyHSD()` function to conduct the Tukey Test. We simply pass `TukeyHSD()` the ANOVA table resulting from the `aov()` function and the pairwise tests for differences are conducted. Run the code cell below to conduct the Tukey Test and view the results.

```{r tukey, exercise = TRUE}
ANOVAtable <- aov(Petal.Width ~ Species, data = iris)
TukeyHSD(ANOVAtable)
```

```{r tukey-test-interp, echo = FALSE}
quiz(
  question_checkbox(
    "Use the output from the code cell above to identify all of the pairs of species of iris which have significantly different average petal widths.",
    answer("Versicolor and Setosa", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Virginica and Setosa", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Virginica and Versicolor", correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    random_answer_order = FALSE
  )
)
```

###

You likely looked at the adjusted $p$-value column in the output from running the Tukey Test in order to make your decisions. You could also compare the confidence intervals for the differences -- since none of the confidence intervals include a plausible difference of 0, we have evidence to suggest that all pairs of group means differ.

Run the code in the cell below to produce a visual that shows the confidence intervals for the pairwise differences in group means. 

```{r tukey-plot, exercise = TRUE}
ANOVAtable <- aov(Petal.Width ~ Species, data = iris)

TukeyHSD(ANOVAtable) %>%
  tidy() %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(
    x = estimate, 
    y = contrast,
    color = contrast)) + 
  geom_errorbarh(aes(
    xmin = conf.low,
    xmax = conf.high,
    y = contrast,
    color = contrast
  )) + 
  geom_vline(
    xintercept = 0,
    linetype = "dashed",
    linewidth = 1.5) + 
  labs(
    title = "Confidence Intervals for Pairwise Petal Width Differences",
    x = "Estimated Difference in Average Petal Widths (cm)",
    y = ""
  ) + 
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

```{r tukey-plot-hint-1}
#You could generate a plot containing the same information
#by running the following code, it just doesn't look as
#nice.
plot(TukeyHSD(ANOVAtable))
```

Which way do you prefer to view, interpret, and communicate the results -- the table, the visual, or a combination of the two?

## Summary

Good work. Through this workbook you developed the ability to conduct a hypothesis test which compares many group means (more than two). 

+ ANOVA tests can be used to determine whether significant evidence exists to suggest that at least one group has a mean which differs from another group. 
+ We saw that ANOVA tests use the F-distribution and are typically conducted via software but that the mechanics of hypothesis testing remain the same. 
+ We also saw that we can conduct ANOVA tests in R using the `aov()` function.
+ Remember that ANOVA can only indicate that at least one group mean significantly differs from another. We need further analysis, such as a Tukey Test, to determine which pair(s) of group means differ significantly from one another.
