## Linear Regression (Lab)

###

In this workbook, we consider an advanced technique for building a statistical model which can be used to explain phenomena, understand relationships, and predict outcomes. If you think about the inference portion of applied statistics so far, we've discussed how to conduct inference on a single numerical or categorical variable and then moved on to discuss inference on a numerical or categorical variable with an additional grouping variable (our two-sample tests, ANOVA, and $\chi^2$). In the latter cases, the grouping variable needed to be a categorical variable (gender, automatic or manual transmission, type of diet eaten, etc.) -- the questions we asked and answered were of the form, given observations which differ by the categorical variable $X$, do they differ in another variable of interest $Y$?

###

Another way of phrasing this is that our inference applications seek to answer the question, "*within our population of interest, is there an association between the variable $X$ and the variable $Y$?*". If both variables $X$ and $Y$ are numerical, then we develop a new statistical inference technique called linear regression.

## An Introduction to Linear Regression

###

Let's check in with a few short videos from our friends at OpenIntro.org to help develop the notion of linear regression for us.

###

Simple linear regression uses a single numerical feature (predictor variable) to predict a numerical response. Simple linear regression uses the form of a straight line $y = mx + b$, where $m$ denotes slope of the relationship and $b$ denotes the intercept (the value of $y$ if $x$ is 0). With regression, we are fitting a straight line to data, where noise is present -- that is, the line we fit is not expected to pass through all of the data points. The form for a simple regression model is
$$\displaystyle{y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x + \varepsilon}$$

###

Notice that $\beta_0$ is the intercept, $\beta_1$ is the slope, and $\varepsilon$ denotes the unexplained error (noise). We typically do not write $\varepsilon$ as part of the model, since we assume that it is random noise with a mean of $0$ and a constant standard deviation ($\sigma$) -- in our earlier notation, we assume $\varepsilon \sim N\left(\mu = 0, \sigma\right)$. Instead, we often write the regression model as
$$\displaystyle{\mathbb{E}\left[y\right] = \beta_0 + \beta_1x}$$

###

We can use regression models to predict an expected average response ($y$) for a given value of the feature $x$. Regression models are only as good as the data they are trained on. Typically we can feel comfortable using a regression model to interpolate predictions (make predictions within the range of observed feature values) but not for extrapolation -- making predictions for values of the predictor variable outside of the range of its observed values.

###

Let's see regression in action as we consider an application to understanding biases in course evaluations.

## The Data

###

Many college courses conclude by giving students the opportunity to evaluate the course and the instructor anonymously. However, the use of these student evaluations as an indicator of course quality and teaching effectiveness is often criticized because these measures may reflect the influence of non-teaching related characteristics, such as the physical appearance of the instructor. The article titled, "Beauty in the classroom: instructors' pulchritude and putative pedagogical productivity" (Hamermesh and Parker, 2005) found that instructors who are viewed to be better looking receive higher instructional ratings. (Daniel S. Hamermesh, Amy Parker, Beauty in the classroom: instructors pulchritude and  putative pedagogical productivity, *Economics of Education Review*, Volume 24, Issue 4, August 2005, Pages 369-376, ISSN 0272-7757, 10.1016/j.econedurev.2004.07.013. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775704001165](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775704001165).)

In this lab we will analyze the data from this study in order to learn what goes into a positive professor evaluation.

###

The data were gathered from end of semester student evaluations for a large sample of professors from the University of Texas at Austin. In addition, six students rated the professors' physical appearance. (This is a slightly modified version of the original data set that was released as part of the replication data for *Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models* (Gelman and Hill, 2007).) The result is a data frame where each row contains a different course and columns represent variables about the courses and professors.

Use the code block below to draw a histogram of the distribution of the `score` variable in the `evals` data frame. Use your histogram to answer the questions that follow.
```{r hist-scores, exercise = TRUE}

```

###

Use the code block below to explore relationships between the other variables in the `evals` data frame. Consider your variables and their types as you construct appropriate visualizations.
```{r data-viz, exercise = TRUE}

```

## Simple Linear Regression: 

###

The fundamental phenomenon suggested by the Gelman and Hill study is that better looking teachers are evaluated more favorably. Use the code block below to create a scatterplot to see if this appears to be the case. Put `bty_avg` along the horizontal axis and `score` along the vertical axis.
```{r bty-score, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r bty-score-solution}
ggplot(data = evals) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = bty_avg, y = score))
```

```{r bty-score-check}
grade_code()
```

###

Before we draw conclusions about the trend, compare the number of observations in the data frame with the approximate number of points on the scatterplot. Is anything awry?

Use the code block below to replot the scatterplot, but this time use `geom_jitter()` instead of `geom_point()`. What was misleading about the initial scatterplot?
```{r bty-score-jitter, exercise = TRUE}

```

###

Let's see if the apparent trend in the plot is something more than natural variation. Use the code block below to fit a linear model called `m_bty` to predict average professor score by average beauty rating. In R, we use the `lm()` function to build a linear regression model and then the `summary()` function to view it. The code is provided -- you can just run it.
```{r simple-reg-model, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
m_bty <- lm(score ~ bty_avg, data = evals)
summary(m_bty)
```

###

```{r interp-reg, echo = FALSE}
quiz(
  question_radio(
    "Is average beauty score a *statistically* significant predictor of overall instructor evaluation score?",
    answer("Yes, the $p$-value associated with `bty_avg` is below 0.05.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Yes, the coefficient estimate is not 0."),
    answer("No, the R-squared values are quite small."),
    answer("No, the $p$-value associated with the intercept is smaller than the $p$-value associated with `bty_avg`."),
    answer("No, the $p$-value associated with `bty_avg` is above 0.05."),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    random_answer_order = TRUE
  ),
  question_radio(
    "What is the approximate value of the `intercept` associated with the linear model we created?",
    answer("0"),
    answer("0.067"),
    answer("3.88", correct = TRUE),
    answer("2e-16"),
    answer("0.076"),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    random_answer_order = TRUE
  ),
  question_radio(
    "What is the *slope* of the regression model with respect to average beauty rating?",
    answer("0.067", correct = TRUE),
    answer("3.88"),
    answer("5.05e-05"),
    answer("2e-16"),
    answer("0.5348"),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  )
)
```

###

Use the code block below to add the line to your plot by adding a layer with `geom_abline()` using the appropriate `slope` and `intercept` arguments. Write out the equation for the linear model and interpret the slope. 
```{r add-abline, exercise = TRUE}

```

###

```{r practical-predictor, echo = FALSE}
question_radio(
  "From the plot, does it seem that average beauty score is a *practically* significant predictor of overall instructor evaluation score?",
  answer("No. We should not expect that the model using `bty_avg` to predict overall evaluation score will yield accurate pedictions of these scores.", correct = TRUE),
  answer("Yes. There is no difference between statistical and practical significance."),
  answer("Yes. Students give better scores to instructors who are better looking."),
  answer("Yes. Students give worse scores to instructors who are better looking."),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  random_answer_order = TRUE
)
```

###

```{r sig-not-pract, echo = FALSE}
question_radio(
  "What does it mean that average beauty rating is a significant predictor of overall course rating score but not a practical predictor?",
  answer("The regression model suggests that there is implicit bias in the course evaluation scores depending on the attractiveness of the instructor.", correct = TRUE),
  answer("The regression model resulted in a Type I error, claiming a significant relationship where there was none."),
  answer("The significant relationship between beauty rating and overall evaluation score is a result of noise in the sample data."),
  answer("The attractiveness of an instructor is a driving force in the way students rate their courses."),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  random_answer_order = TRUE
)
```

## Multiple Linear Regression

###

We now expand the predictors under consideration so that we may better understand instructor- and course-related factors which, on average, lead to the highest evaluation scores. We'll start by building a model including almost all of the predictors, and then reducing that model to include only significant predictors of overall evaluation `score`.

###

First, we'll check in with Dr. &Ccedil;etinkaya-Rundel again for some quick discussions on multiple linear regression.

###

Multiple regression is a natural generalization of simple regression. In multiple regression we are allowed to include more than just a single predictor. That is, a multiple regression model takes the form:
$$\displaystyle{\mathbb{E}\left[y\right] = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + \cdots + \beta_kx_k}$$
Predictors in a multiple regression model may be numerical or categorical. In the case that a variable is numerical, its coefficient is a *slope* coefficient, describing the expected change in the response variable given a one-unit change in the corresponding predictor if all other features remain constant. In the case that a variable is categorical, the coefficient is a vertical shift parameter (impacting the intercept). There are alot of intricacies here and advanced techniques to consider -- look for a full course on regression analysis to see more!

###

There is no guarantee that the most complicated regression model will yield the best predictions. One way to measure the quality of a multiple regression model is with the *adjusted-R-squared* metric. This metric seeks to explain the variability in the response which is explained by the model, but penalizes more complex models (models with fewer terms are preferrable due to their simplicity). Values of adjusted-R-squared closer to 1 indicate higher explanatory value.

###

Since the most complex models are not necessarily the best, we often start with a large model (sometimes called a *full model*), and reduce the model by removing one insignificant predictor at a time -- removing the predictor corresponding to the highest $p$-value at each step -- until we have a model in which all predictors are significant. This procedure is often referred to as *backward elimination*. Again, there are some intricacies here and you should look for a full course in regression analysis to learn more!

###

Now we get back to our application of regression to analyzing course evaluations. The code block below is pre-set to build a regression model including nearly all of the predictors available in the `evals` dataset. Use the code block to build the regression model, view its summary, and answer the questions that follow.

**Aside:** You'll notice that, rather that including all of the predictors related to beauty ratings, we include only the `bty_avg` predictor. We make this choice because the beauty variables are highly correlated with one another -- in some sense, they encode the same information. Including highly correlated predictors can cause problems for regression -- look for a full course in regression analysis to learn more about regression and potential pitfalls.

```{r full-model, exercise = TRUE}
#build regression model
m_full <- lm(score ~ ethnicity + gender + language + age + cls_perc_eval + cls_students + cls_level + cls_profs + cls_credits + bty_avg + pic_color + pic_outfit, data = evals)
#view model summary
summary(m_full)
```

###

```{r interp-summary-full, echo = FALSE}
quiz(
  question_checkbox(
    "Using $\\alpha = 0.05$, which of the following predictor variables in the model are **not** statistically significant?",
    answer("`ethnicity`", correct = TRUE),
    answer("`gender`"),
    answer("`language`"),
    answer("`age`"),
    answer("`cls_perc_eval`"),
    answer("`cls_students`", correct = TRUE),
    answer("`cls_level`", correct = TRUE), 
    answer("`cls_profs`", correct = TRUE), 
    answer("`cls_credits`"), 
    answer("`bty_avg`"), 
    answer("`pic_color`"), 
    answer("`pic_outfit`", correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question_radio(
    "How many of the predictor variables should be removed from consideration before re-running the regression model?",
    answer("0"),
    answer("1", correct = TRUE),
    answer("2"),
    answer("3"),
    answer("4"),
    answer("5"),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  )
)
```

###

Use the code block below to remove the predictor corresponding to the highest $p$-value (just delete it from the code which constructs the model). Re-run the model and print the summary.
```{r model-second-it, exercise = TRUE}
m_reduce1 <- lm(score ~ ethnicity + gender + language + age + cls_perc_eval + cls_students + cls_level + cls_profs + cls_credits + bty_avg + pic_color + pic_outfit, data = evals)

summary(m_reduce1)
```

```{r model-second-it-solution}
m_reduce1 <- lm(score ~ ethnicity + gender + language + age + cls_perc_eval + cls_students + cls_level + cls_credits + bty_avg + pic_color + pic_outfit, data = evals)

summary(m_reduce1)
```

```{r model-second-it-check}
grade_code()
```

###

Use the code block below to continue reducing the model, removing one predictor at a time.
```{r model-reducing, exercise = TRUE}

```

Use the code block below to build the final model as `m_final` and print the model summary.
```{r model-final, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r model-final-solution}
m_final <- lm(score ~ ethnicity + gender + language + age + cls_perc_eval + cls_credits + bty_avg + pic_color, data = evals)
summary(m_final)
```

```{r model-final-check}
grade_code()
```

###

```{r select-characteristics, echo = FALSE}
question_checkbox(
  "Select the characteristics of an instructor and course which is predicted to score well on the course evaluations.",
  answer("A non-minority instructor", correct = TRUE),
  answer("A male instructor", correct = TRUE),
  answer("An instructor whose education background was taught in English", correct = TRUE),
  answer("An older instructor"),
  answer("A class which has a high percentage of students completing course evaluations", correct = TRUE),
  answer("A single-credit course", correct = TRUE),
  answer("An *attractive* instructor", correct = TRUE),
  answer("An instructor whose picture on the evaluation is printed in color"),
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

###

As in the case of the simple regression model, we found several *statistically* significant predictors of overall course evaluation score. While these predictors are indeed statistically significant, they are not necessarily *practically* significant. This means that, while we should not expect that the characteristics identified above are primary drivers of overall course evaluation score, we've replicated the finding of Hamermesh and Parker that there are several implicit biases in the instrument used to measure course evaluation score.
