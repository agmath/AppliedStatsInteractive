## Welcome

###

This is a series of workbooks which is appropriate for use with introductory-level applied statistics courses at the high school or university level. 

###

Very limited mathematics background is assumed. Students able to answer the following two questions have the necessary mathematics background:

+ Find $z$ if 
$$\displaystyle{z = \frac{54 - 50}{8/\sqrt{16}}}$$
+ Find $x$ if 
$$\displaystyle{2 = \frac{x - 50}{8/\sqrt{16}}}$$

###

Each workbook introduces statistics content, asks students to answer questions about their understanding, and allows the user to interact with embedded R code blocks. Immediate feedback is automatically generated once responses are submitted to the questions or embedded code blocks. The code blocks typically ask students to complete example problems or to experiment with the ideas presented, but they'll sometimes be available as a simple calculation space. For all but the workbooks designated as *labs*, users can complete the tasks in the notebook without using R. That is, even if your course does not utilize R, you may find these workbooks to be of use. That being said, I would encourage everyone to embed the use of software in applied statistics coursework -- especially software that is freely, or at least widely, available.

###

Whether you are an instructor, student in an organized classroom setting, or someone learning on their own, I truly hope that you find these workbooks to be helpful. If you have any feedback, I would love to hear it -- you can post any issues directly to the [AppliedStatsInteractive GitHub Repository](https://github.com/agmath/AppliedStatsInteractive) or email me directly at [a.gilbert1@snhu.edu](mailto:a.gilbert12snhu.edu). 

These workbooks are adapted versions of course notes from introductory statistics courses for first-year students at my current institution. Much of the content is supplementary to [OpenIntro.org](http://www.openintro.org) and the [4th edition of OpenIntro Statistics](https://leanpub.com/openintro-statistics) which is open source and freely available. In addition to the free resources available at OpenIntro.org, I've developed a freely available online homework supplement to the OpenIntro Statistics textbook at [MyOpenMath](www.myopenmath.com) -- instructions for gaining access are available from OpenIntro.org. While most of the content does leverage resources from the OpenIntro site and text, the workbook on Data Visualization is adapted from Chapter 3 of [Grolemund and Wickham's *R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/). This text is an excellent addition to the library of any aspiring data scientist. Check it out!

###

In addition to the resources mentioned here, there are several other great resources for introductory statistics and data science. Just a few are [data8](http://data8.org/) a freely available *Foundations of Data Science* course at UC Berkeley (using Python), [Introduction to Modern Statistics](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/preface.html) by Mine &Ccedil;etinkaya-Rundel and Jo Hardin, [Modern Dive](https://moderndive.com/index.html) by Albert Kim and Chester Ismay, and [Data Science in a Box](https://datasciencebox.org/index.html) by Mine &Ccedil;etinkaya-Rundel. I hope you'll check these free resources out.

### 

I've set up an [RStudio.cloud workspace](https://rstudio.cloud/project/2832068) with all of the dependencies and interactive notebooks pre-loaded into it. You can simply follow that link and create your own permanent copy of the workspace to bypass any required setup. You can also choose to run the notebooks locally via an R package as follows:

```{r install, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
#You'll need the devtools library to install a package from GitHub
install.packages("devtools")
#Now, install the package containing the interactive workbooks
remotes::install_github("agmath/AppliedStatsInteractive")
```
The source code for these interactive workbooks is publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/agmath/AppliedStatsInteractive). 

###

Once you've copied the cloud workspace (or installed the package), you should be able to run the tutorials using the `Tutorials` pane (a tab in the top-right pane, by default). Identify the tutorial you'd like to run and click `Start Tutorial`. If you run into any issues here, you may need to install `learnrhash` manually before running the tutorials. You can do so by typing `remotes::install_github("rundel/learnrhash")` in the console and running it. After this package has installed, the workbooks should run.

## What should I know before using these workbooks?

###

If you are considering whether to use these notebooks as part of a course or self-study, there are a few things you should know.

+ It is my intention that these notebooks always remain freely available and open sourced.

+ Although these notebooks are currently in a usable format, they are continually being improved. Be sure to check GitHub for the latest changes and release notes. 

  + If running the packages locally, then those with a most recent version of the `AppliedStatsInteractive` package may notice additional features. For example, I am working on creating/curating, and embedding more video instruction.

+ The `learnrhash` package provides some ability for student progress tracking through these workbooks. At the end of each workbook there is a subsection called *Submit*, which includes a button for students to generate a `hash` code which represents their completed notebook. They can submit these hash codes using a web-based form such as Google Forms. Once you have the csv with the hashes, you can read it into R and use `learnrhash` functionality to reconstruct the student work. See the `learnrhash` documentation [here](https://github.com/rundel/learnrhash).

###

If you are looking for a more traditional online homework system to supplement these workbooks, check out my course template at [MyOpenMath](https://www.myopenmath.com) -- the template course you are looking for is titled `146 OpenIntro Statistics: Diez/Barr/Cetinkaya-Rundel`.

Whether you are an instructor, student, or self-paced-learner, I hope you enjoy your statistics journey. --AG
