## Inference Practice

###

In this workbook, you'll have an opportunity to practice a set of problems. I'm still providing you with a set of guided questions for each problem. Think about the guiding questions and steps necessary to complete each task so that you will be prepared to approach similar problems on your own, without this scaffolding. On the associated homework problems you'll need to come up with these steps on your own. This workbook should prepare you for that.

###

For convenience, here is the [*standard errror decision tree*](https://agmath.github.io/SiteFiles/StdErrorDecisionTree.pdf){target="_blank"}, the general [*strategy for confidence intervals*](https://agmath.github.io/SiteFiles/CIgeneral.pdf){target="_blank"}, and the general [*strategy for hypothesis tests*](https://agmath.github.io/SiteFiles/HTgeneral.pdf){target="_blank"}. For any problems involving hypothesis tests, assume the $\alpha = 0.05$ level of significance unless otherwise stated.

### 

> **Note:** There are no hints included in this notebook. You should use the resources linked above and your previous notebooks to help you. This first three problems include links to fully worked solutions, but you'll be on your own for the remaining problems.

## Problem 1

**Problem 1:** The distribution of the number of eggs laid by a certain species of hen during their breeding period is 35 eggs with a standard deviation of 18.2. Suppose a group of researchers randomly samples 45 hens of this species, counts the number of eggs laid during their breeding period, and records a sample mean of 37 eggs. Find the probability of observing a sample of 45 hens whose mean number of eggs laid during the breeding period is at least 37.

###

Use the code block below to compute the probability of observing a random sample of 45 hens from this species which lays an average of at least 37 eggs.

```{r prob1-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r prob1-5-check}

```

## Problem 2

**Problem 2:** A recent study looked at average ages of male and female inmates on Death Row. The random sample of 9 women and 14 men on death row resulted in the following: 

<center>
$\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline & \text{Men} & \text{Women} \\ \hline
\bar{x} & 39 & 44\\ \hline
s & 4.5 & 6.2 \\ \hline \end{array}$
</center>

Conduct a hypothesis test to determine whether there is evidence to suggest that the men on Death Row are, on average, younger than women on Death Row. (In case of emergency, [see worked solution here](www/SampleInferenceDeathRow.pdf){target="_blank"})

## Problem 4

**Problem 4:** In January 2011, The Marist Poll published a report stating that 66% of adults nationally think licensed drivers should be required to retake their road test once they reach 65 years of age.

Construct a 95% confidence interval for the true proportion of New Hampshirites who are in favor of this proposal.

## Problem 5

**Problem 5:** A pollster working for Pete Buttigieg is interested in identifying the proportion of registered democrats planning to vote in the NH primary for whom Mayor Pete is their first OR second choice candidate. If the pollster wants to estimate this proportion to within one percentage-point and at 95% confidence, how many voters should the pollster include in a sample if data from a focus group suggests that the proportion is near 42%?

Use the code block below to either input or compute the desired margin of error.

```{r prob5-3-setup}
Sys.sleep(2)
```

```{r prob5-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r prob5-3-check}
grade_result(
  pass_if(~ (.result == 0.01))
)
```

###

Use the code block below to either input or critical value ($z_{\alpha/2}$) which should be used to compute the required sample size.

```{r prob5-4-setup}
Sys.sleep(2)
```

```{r prob5-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r prob5-4-check}
grade_result(
  pass_if(~ (abs(.result - qnorm(0.975)) < 0.01))

```

```{r prob5-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r prob5-5-check}
grade_result(
  pass_if(~ (.result == 0.42))
)
```

###

Use the code block below to compute the minimum size sample the pollster could take and be within his parameters.

```{r prob5-6-setup}
Sys.sleep(2)
```

```{r prob5-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r prob5-6-check}
grade_result(
  pass_if(~ ((abs(.result - (ceiling((qnorm(0.975)/0.01)^2*0.42*(1 - 0.42)))) < 10) & (.result - ceiling(.result) == 0)))
  #pass_if(~ (.result == ceiling((qnorm(0.975)/0.01)^2*0.42*(1 - 0.42))))
)
```

###

In the last problem, did you remember to round your answer up? Rounding the required sample size down results in either a loss of confidence or an increased margin of error, violating the requirements for the estimate.

## Problem 6

**Problem 6:** Greece has faced a severe economic crisis since the end of 2009. A Gallup poll surveyed 1,000 randomly sampled Greeks in 2011 and found that 25% of them said they would rate their lives poorly enough to be considered suffering. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the true proportion of Greeks who are suffering.

## Problem 7

**Problem 7:** A "social experiment" conducted by a TV program questioned what people do when they see a very angry father upset with his child about their poor athletic performance. On two different occasions at the same restaurant, a father and child were depicted. In one scenario the man was upset with a son and in the other scenario he was angry with a daughter. The table below shows how many restaurant diners were present under each scenario, and whether or not they intervened.

<center>$\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline \text{Scenario} & \text{Son} & \text{Daughter} & \text{Total} \\ \hline

## Problem 8

**Problem 8:** A University has a policy that its sports teams require no more than 15 hours per week of time commitment from players during off-season.

Is there evidence to suggest that the University Quidditch Coach is not following University Policy? Use $\alpha = 0.10$.

## Problem 9

**Problem 9:** A market researcher wants to evaluate car insurance savings at a competing company. Based on past studies he is assuming that the standard deviation of savings is \$100. He wants to collect data such that he can get a margin of error of no more than \$10 at a 95% confidence level. How large of a sample should he collect?

## Problem 10

**Problem 10:** A Washington Post article from 2009 reported that "support for a government-run health-care plan to compete with private insurers has rebounded from its summertime lows and wins clear majority support from the public." More specifically, the article says "seven in 10 Democrats back the plan, while almost nine in 10 Republicans oppose it. Independents divide 52 percent against, 42 percent in favor of the legislation." (6% responded with "other".) There were 819 Democrats, 566 Republicans and 783 Independents surveyed. A political pundit on TV claims that a majority of Independents oppose the health care public option plan. Do these data provide significant evidence to support this statement?

## Problem 11

**Problem 11:** Is there strong evidence of global warming? Let's consider a small scale example on just a single metric, comparing how temperatures have changed in the US from 1968 to 2008. The daily high temperature reading on January 1 was collected in 1968 and 2008 for 51 randomly selected locations in the continental US. Then the difference between the two readings (temperature in 2008 - temperature in 1968) was calculated for each of the 51 different locations. The average of these 51 values was 1.1 degrees with a standard deviation of 4.9 degrees. We are interested in determining whether these data provide strong evidence of temperature warming in the continental US. Conduct a hypothesis test to determine whether there is significant evidence for an increase in average temperature between 1968 and 2008.
